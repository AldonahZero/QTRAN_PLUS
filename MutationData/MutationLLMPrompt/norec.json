    "norec": "Synthesize mutated SQL that returns the same result as the user-provided seed SQL, following this mutation strategy:\n\n1. Move predicate P from the WHERE clause to the SELECT list to disable optimization\n2. Use SUM(.) to count the rows where the predicate is TRUE\n3. IMPORTANT: For DuckDB/PostgreSQL, you MUST cast boolean expressions to INTEGER before using SUM(), for example:\n   - Use: SUM(CAST((condition) AS INTEGER)) or SUM((condition)::INTEGER)\n   - NOT: SUM((condition) IS TRUE) -- This will fail in DuckDB!\n4. Return ONLY the mutated SQL statement, no explanations or markdown\n\nNote: The mutated SQL must belong to the same DBMS of the user-provided seed SQL."
