Since the empty binary string cannot be converted to an integer, I modified the condition to compare against 0, which is a valid integer. The use of 'ANY_VALUE' for columns c0 and c2 remains to satisfy the GROUP BY requirement. This maintains the original column names and adheres to the requirement of not introducing meaningless features or random return values while ensuring the statement is executable in DuckDB."}], "TransferCost": [{"Total Tokens": 9036, "Prompt Tokens": 8906, "Completion Tokens": 130, "Total Cost (USD)": 0.0014138999999999998}, {"Total Tokens": 9443, "Prompt Tokens": 9277, "Completion Tokens": 166, "Total Cost (USD)": 0.00149115}, {"Total Tokens": 9872, "Prompt Tokens": 9694, "Completion Tokens": 178, "Total Cost (USD)": 0.0015609}, {"Total Tokens": 10308, "Prompt Tokens": 10124, "Completion Tokens": 184, "Total Cost (USD)": 0.001629}, {"Total Tokens": 10743, "Prompt Tokens": 10566, "Completion Tokens": 177, "Total Cost (USD)": 0.0016911}], "TransferTimeCost": 81.618617, "TransferSqlExecResult": ["None", "None", "None", "None", "[]"], "TransferSqlExecError": ["(duckdb.duckdb.BinderException) Binder Error: column \"c0\" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or must be part of an aggregate function.\nEither add it to the GROUP BY list, or use \"ANY_VALUE(c0)\" if the exact value of \"c0\" is not important.\n[SQL: SELECT * FROM t0 WHERE x'' > t0.c2 GROUP BY c1]\n(Background on this error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/20/f405)", "(duckdb.duckdb.ConversionException) Conversion Error: Could not convert string 'x' to INT32\nLINE 1: ...E(c0), c1, ANY_VALUE(c2) FROM t0 WHERE x'' > t0.c2 GROUP BY c1\n                                                  ^\n[SQL: SELECT ANY_VALUE(c0), c1, ANY_VALUE(c2) FROM t0 WHERE x'' > t0.c2 GROUP BY c1]\n(Background on this error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/20/9h9h)", "(duckdb.duckdb.BinderException) Binder Error: Cannot compare values of type VARCHAR and type INTEGER - an explicit cast is required\nLINE 1: ...c2) FROM t0 WHERE CAST(x'' AS VARCHAR) > t0.c2 GROUP BY c1\n                                                  ^\n[SQL: SELECT ANY_VALUE(c0), c1, ANY_VALUE(c2) FROM t0 WHERE CAST(x'' AS VARCHAR) > t0.c2 GROUP BY c1]\n(Background on this error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/20/f405)", "(duckdb.duckdb.ConversionException) Conversion Error: Could not convert string 'x' to INT32\nLINE 1: ...E(c0), c1, ANY_VALUE(c2) FROM t0 WHERE CAST(x'' AS INTEGER) > t0.c2 GROUP BY c...\n                                                  ^\n[SQL: SELECT ANY_VALUE(c0), c1, ANY_VALUE(c2) FROM t0 WHERE CAST(x'' AS INTEGER) > t0.c2 GROUP BY c1]\n(Background on this error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/20/9h9h)", "None"], "TransferSqlExecEqualities": [false, false, false, false, false]}
