The use of 'COLLATE NOCASE' was omitted because MariaDB does not require it for the CHAR function to handle case sensitivity in this context. The alias 'AS temp' was added to the subquery to ensure proper syntax in MariaDB, which requires subqueries to have an alias. All column names and feature variables remain unchanged, and the translation adheres to the specified requirements."}], "TransferCost": [{"Total Tokens": 555, "Prompt Tokens": 406, "Completion Tokens": 149, "Total Cost (USD)": 0.0001503}], "TransferTimeCost": 32.433097, "TransferSqlExecResult": ["[('0000',)]"], "TransferSqlExecError": ["None"], "TransferSqlExecEqualities": [true]}
