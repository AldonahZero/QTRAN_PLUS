In PostgreSQL, we ensure that the number is explicitly cast to numeric to maintain precision and avoid unexpected results. The syntax '0.1::numeric' is used to convert the floating-point number to a numeric type, which is compatible with the ROUND function in PostgreSQL. This translation maintains the original semantics while adhering to the specified requirements."}], "TransferCost": [{"Total Tokens": 510, "Prompt Tokens": 386, "Completion Tokens": 124, "Total Cost (USD)": 0.0001323}], "TransferTimeCost": 31.366297, "TransferSqlExecResult": ["[(Decimal('0.1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 ...
