The 'CREATE TABLE' statement is translated to 'db.createCollection' to create a collection in MongoDB. 2. The 'INSERT INTO' statement is converted to 'db.t0.insert' to insert a document into the collection. 3. The 'SELECT' statement is modified to use MongoDB's query syntax. Since MongoDB does not support the 'UNION' operation directly, I used '$expr' to evaluate the condition. The condition 'WHERE false' is replaced with a query that always returns an empty result, and 'WHERE NOT t0.c1' is not directly translatable since 'c1' is a computed field. Instead, I used a placeholder expression that evaluates to true, ensuring that the semantics of the original query are preserved as closely as possible while adhering to the requirements."}, {"TransferSQL": ["db.createCollection('t0');", "db.t0.insertOne({c0: 0});", "db.t0.find({$expr: {$and: [{$eq: [0, 0]}, {$not: {$exists: '$c1'}}]}}).toArray();"], "Explanation": "1.
