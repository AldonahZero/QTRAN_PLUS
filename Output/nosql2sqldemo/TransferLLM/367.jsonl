The insertion of a boolean value is represented as 'db.t0.insert({c0: true});', where '0' is interpreted as 'false' in TiDB, and thus we use 'true' for a valid boolean representation. The SELECT statement 'SELECT * FROM t0 WHERE 1 AND 0.4;' is translated to 'db.t0.find({$expr: {$and: [true, 0.4]}});', using MongoDB's $expr operator to evaluate the logical expression. This ensures that the semantics are preserved while adhering to the requirements of avoiding meaningless features."}, {"TransferSQL": ["db.createCollection('t0');", "db.t0.insert({c0: true});", "db.t0.find({$expr: {$and: [true, {$gt: [0.4, 0]}]}});"], "Explanation": "In response to the error message regarding unsupported MongoDB statement types, I modified the SELECT statement. The original 'db.t0.find({$expr: {$and: [true, 0.4]}});' was incorrect because it attempted to use a direct numeric value in a logical expression. Instead, I replaced '0.4' with a comparison expression '{$gt: [0.4, 0]}', which checks if 0.4 is greater than 0, thus ensuring that the query remains valid and executable in MongoDB.
