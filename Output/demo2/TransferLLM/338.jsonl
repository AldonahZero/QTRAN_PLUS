The original SQLite statement selects the minimum value of a union of two character sets. In Redis, we can use simple string values to represent these characters. Here, I've replaced CHAR(0, 1) and CHAR(0, 0) with their string representations ('0'). The HEX function is not directly available in Redis, but we can assume that the minimum value will still be '0', and thus its HEX representation will also be '00'.

Instead, we can use the EVAL command to run Lua scripts. The modified statement uses Lua to define two local variables 'a1' and 'a2' with the values '0', simulating the union of character sets.

The previous attempt used string values, which caused an error when trying to perform mathematical operations. In this modification, I've changed 'a1' and 'a2' to be integers (0) instead of strings.
