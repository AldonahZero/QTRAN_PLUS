The '$sin' operator computes the sine of a number, similar to the SIN function in DuckDB. The 'db.collection.find' is used to execute the query, and we return the computed sine value in the 'result' field.

Instead, I've modified the statement to use the 'aggregate' method with '$project', which allows us to compute the sine of 1e1000 and return it in the 'result' field.

This stage groups all documents (in this case, we use '_id: null' to group all into a single document) and computes the sine of 1e1000, returning it in the 'result' field.
