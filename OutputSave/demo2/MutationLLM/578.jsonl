In Redis, the ROUND function is not directly available, but since the requirement is to keep the semantics as similar as possible, the same statement is retained. However, it's important to note that Redis does not support floating-point rounding in the same way as SQL databases, and the result may not be meaningful. Thus, while the syntax is preserved, the execution may not yield a valid numeric result in Redis."}, {"TransferSQL": "EVAL 'ROUND(0.1, 1000)'", "Explanation": "Redis does not support SQL-like SELECT statements, so the original SQL statement cannot be directly executed. Instead, I used the EVAL command to execute a Lua script that mimics the rounding operation.

The requirement to keep the semantics similar is maintained by attempting to round the number 0.1 to 1000 decimal places, but the actual execution will depend on the implementation of rounding logic in your application or through a Lua script that would need to be defined separately."}, {"TransferSQL": "SET result 0.1", "Explanation": "Given the constraints of Redis and the errors encountered with previous attempts, I've simplified the statement to directly set a key named 'result' to the value 0.1.
