The transfer involves using EVAL to simulate the UNION operation and the CHAR function. However, please note that Redis does not support MIN or HEX functions directly in the same way as SQL.

The `string.byte` function is used to get the byte values of the characters, and `math.min` is applied to find the minimum value. The `string.format` function is then used to convert the result to hexadecimal format. This approach maintains the column name 'a' and adheres to the requirement of avoiding meaningless features.
